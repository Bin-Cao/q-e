This package (QEheat) calculates the ab-initio energy flux, when velocities are provided in additions to positions in a QuantumEspresso input file.

The folders cointain:

`Doc` : the html files documenting the QEheat input, to be opened with a browser (e.g. firefox).

`examples` : a folder with examples of QEheat computations. Start here to test your code/installation .

`src` : the files used by QEheat.

`tests` : the test utility used mainly for development purposes. It can be used also for testing purposes with the command make run-tests .


###
############ INSTALLATION OVERVIEW #############
###
#### Before running the examples, you need to be sure that QEHeat is installed.
#### To do this, first perform a standard Quantum-Espresso installation. For a basic one, in the main directory execute the commands:
#### ./configure
#### make pw 
#### This should produce the standard pw.x executable. To compile Qeheat just you need to enter the correct folder :
#### cd /energy_current/src
#### make
#### This should produce the executable all_currents.x in the src and bin folders.
