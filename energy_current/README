This package (QEheat) calculates the ab-initio energy flux, when velocities are provided in additions to positions in a QuantumEspresso input file.

The folders cointain:

`Doc` : the html files documenting the QEheat input, to be opened with a browser (e.g. firefox).

`examples` : a folder with examples of QEheat computations. Start here to test your code/installation .

`src` : the files used by QEheat.

`tests` : the test utility used mainly for development purposes. It can be used also for testing purposes with the command make run-tests .


# INSTALLATION OVERVIEW
###
#### Before running the examples, you need to be sure that QEHeat is installed.
#### To compile, we suggest the following procedure. As usual in a QuantumEspresso installation, enter the distribution folder and run autoconf :
####
#### > ./configure
#### 
#### Enter than the QEHeat folder and compile:
####
#### >  cd /energy_current/src
#### >  make all
####
#### This should produce in a single shot the executables pw.x, cp.x and also all_currents.x, the executable for QEHeat, in the respective src and bin folders.
####
#### TROUBLESHOOT: 
#### If problems occurs, we suggest to enter the main folder of the distribution and compile only pw.x independently:
####
#### >  make clean
#### >  make veryclean
#### >  ./configure
#### >  make pw
####
#### This way one can recognize if the problem comes from compiling QEHeat or the standard QuantumEspresso distribution.
